dw - specialized functionality/components/patterns for building complex web applications quickly -- toolkit for building custom admins and the sites they power


DW internet application development system - a software development kit for building complex applications quickly, with the littlest amount of technical overhead (building things in a responsible way, easy-to-maintain complex functionality)

  LAMP-based ADK (application development kit)




<br /><br />


<h2>INSTALLATION</h2>



# installation updates

-- dw init checklist --
- [x] create subdomain/domain
  - [x] & ftp (if necessary)
  - [x] add profile (ftp creds) to coda
- [x] create database
  - [x] & user
  - [x] add db creds to coda (if necessary, not needed for eqkh/purhost sites)
  - [ ] ** always use innodb/utf8 ** (myisam is default on most systems, but innodb is what you want)
- [x] download dw from darkwave.ltd & upload files to ftp & visit site to install

- [ ] 'install' modules -- currently everything is based on blog
  -- https://github.com/hxgf/dw-blog-ui
  -- https://github.com/hxgf/dw-blog-stereo


sites setup checklist add (for me personally)
- automated mysql backups
- automated git backups




dw install instructions / requirements
- file/folder perms (writeable/editable files/dirs need to be 755)
- galleries
  - php upload max size / max post size (set w/ host or htaccess)
  - imagemagick
- possibly allow_url_fopen?


dw checklist reminder to update max filesize (outside scope of fw, but something you still need to do in some cases)





dw install
- create the db & user on your own (reqs for user perms, db creation)
- put the files on your server (w/ ftp)
  - requirements - lamp stack (apache w/ htaccess & speficif modules enabled)(instructions for doing it w/ nginx)
- chmod some files?
- go to the site & run the install





prerequisites
- php (version?)
- mysql (version?)
  - db already set up w/ username & pw


1. download zip & put it on your server (go to the site, do the install thing)
2. delete the install file (controllers/install.php) (the installer should delete itself when it's done, but just in case, you should do it)
3. have a good time! [it's pretty much stereo & tachyons from this point, so look at the docs for that]


- upload folder needs to be set to 755 (correct?)




creating a new user:

  $email = "nacho.pizza@gmail.com";
  $password = "pencil69";
  $screenname = "admin69";

  $new_id = db_insert("users", array(
    'email' => strtolower($email),
    'password' => password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT),
    'group_id' => '1',
    'date_created' => time(),

    'url_title' => url_title($screenname),
    'screenname' => $screenname,
  ));

  echo $new_id;





      - ideal setup
        - php7
        - ssd host/vps


      - requirements
        - upload (max filesize, post filesize, etc)
          - note upload perms (www-data, 0755)
        - imagemagick
        - mysql (version?)
        - php (version?)
        - apc (recommended)
        - curl

        - prefs
          - image upload path
          - markdown
          - timezone



      dw php.ini
            - post_max_size = 20M
            - upload_max_filesize = 20M
      - curl needs to be enabled
      - mail (postfix might be needed on some hosts)







??

dw install - put labels or "info" mouseovers
    automatically add/remove "http(s)" where needed
        remove trailing slashes where needed
    on success show success message
        don't link to admin unless there's been an admin created
    is there a way to re-initialize the install process (in case you decide later that you want to install an admin? just want to get started with the site architecture first?)



- install process error reporting (files need to be writeable? db errors? missing fields? etc?)

install reqs
    mysql user that can create/alter tables
    ability to write to filesystem

darkwave reqs
    imagemagick (version?)
    
install
    better logic? idk...just make damn sure there are no errors before it deletes itself
    catch errors better & show them & have a friendly "go back and fix" message




- install script
    - pre-check (so you can see which features are available...tell people what they need to change in order to make it compatible...maybe offer a script?)

<br /><br />





dw is:
- stereo
- extensible admin app
- content mgmt
- simple auth system
- web-app primitives (image management, file uploads, etc)
- future: data manager
- future: code/file manager -- can edit/manage the entire app from here
- helpful error messages for things like uploads, logins, etc
- form handling and validation (primitives, checking required/type, etc)
- a consistent and reliable (unchanging) architecture to build against
pragmatic, ehthos, brutalist, simple, boring, fast, fun
- helper js libraries (dropzone, smoke, etc)
- copy/paste components/patterns / building blocks for building specific types of functionality
- pre-packaged 'manual plug-in' functionality
- recommendations for tools to use for solving problems that aren't solved w/ the system
- tutorials /checklists for how to build certain kinds of things w/ this
(every time you want to do this, here's what you need to do/consider)
talking 'newbs' through more complex operations (kinda like coaching someone through disarming a bomb or hooking up a sound system) (and helpful notes for debugging - [ie "photo uploads not working? check to make sure you created the upload folder and that it has the right permissions])
recipe / cookbook
how to build a
directory of profiles for your organization
generic blog site
todo list app haha
podcast cms?

need MORE POWER? build an obelisk! here's how!

<br /><br />


KITCHEN SINK
- db collection init scripts
- copy/paste admin screens (blog?)
- generic form/photo updating from DAA user/trade/project
	- kitchen sink form w/ every type of input / data structure
- corollary copy/paste "front end" components
	(?? OIP blog, files)


<br /><br />

# DOCS / EDUCATION / TUTORIALS

[ ] better docs (describe what the system actually does, how to work with it, how to extend it)

  // foundational info
    // what it does
      // what it includes
    // why would you use it 


wow this readme has drop-downs, cool to do that for dw readme? https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions#readme


meta - need to suppress php warnings? (filling up the log file?)
  try this: error_reporting(E_ERROR | E_PARSE);


a manual (/field guide) for building (effective/attractive/solid/usable) web sites/applications with as little (fanfare/suffering/pretense/) as possible
  key concept: build your thing, call it done, go hang out with your friends
    development is central to some people's lives, but you're a real person with a real life. 
    you can over-engineer anything to death, if you're a perfectionist, you'll never be happy with it, there's always something that could be better
    make it good enough (and do a really good job), but know when to stop and call it done
  instructional guides and resources (links to valuable online tools/libraries that can help you solve problems quickly)




- what's included for the admin (and can be included in your public site) - font awesome, tachyons, alpine, quill, dropzone, etc
    -- links to all the docs for all the libs

  dw docs want to have a reference of all commonly used docs for all the libs included (font awesome icon search, tachyons components, etc)




- copy/paste for FE components/patterns (& link to whatever repos for back end code? copy/pasta?)



- front end / dev resources 
  --- want to have a collection of cool "approved" libraries (ones that we like working with and yield badass results, ideally fitting the same license and ethos of the projects)

  dw docs? separate site/resource? - front end best practices
  - want to have a site (that i can refer to) that documents the workflows, resources and best practices i use/need to be a productive and efficient FE dev
  - notes of all the tools i use for various things (unix time format, generating favicons, etc)





stereo/dw front end -- if you want equal height floated divs, use flex + flex-wrap -- http://tachyons.io/docs/layout/flexbox/
    also if you do a flexbox sticky footer, the flex element needs to be ie11 compliant w/ min height
        the flex element needs to have     `flex: 1 0 auto;`






- Is darkwave for me? -- guide/quiz/questionaire about the type of project you want to build, it tells you wether or not it's a good fit, offers alternatives if it's not (you need laravel, rails, wordpress, etc)


Dark wave light house score?
    - https://blog.logrocket.com/building-a-progressive-web-app-pwa-no-react-no-angular-no-vue-aefdded3b5e



cookbooks for doing various types of projects (simple web site apps \-\-> mobile/pwa apps [tv os, "platform" type cloud services])

  my "best-practices" guide for putting stuff together
  "recipes"
  "spells"
  cool "how-to" instructions, step-by-step guides with colorful commentary

  "building a forum / iphone app w/ darkwave, lexxi, vue, and phonegap" or whatever
    recommendations for cool microservices to work with (braintree, mailgun, compose, etc)


  tips on workflow, setting up your environment, etc

    stereo/dw - this is cool for doing shit locally
    https://github.com/typicode/hotel

    idk mamp? open source alternative?

    recommended editors (atom, coda, iterm, sequel pro, etc)














here's what's included (libs)
  flatpickr https://chmln.github.io/flatpickr/
  dropzone
  smoke
  tachyons
  font awesome
  jquery

  phmagick

  [we're using them in the admin, it's up to you wether or not to use them in your actual projects. we made a note of patterns that utilize these dependencies for customer-facing code]

  - make a note of all the 3rd-party libs & functionality the system comes with (stereo + phmagick + js libs + tachyons + darkwave functions [new_user (back end), post_json (front end) idk what else])
  - tachyons components / resources [[tachyons patterns / meta]]
  - datepicker, quill, dropzone, smoke, etc

      comes bundled with
      jquery [version?]
      js cookie
      jquery text editor
      dropzone
      smoke
      flatpickr
      phmagick
      [darkwave helpers, loaders animations, etc, idk]

      tachyons


dw/stereo docs
- all available global vars ($GLOBALS['user_id'], $GLOBALS['auth'], etc)


global vars you have at your disposal
  user_id // same as cookie
  profile_url // same as cookie
  auth // is user authenticated?
  is_admin // is current user in admin group?
  is_moderator // is current user in mod group?
  locals // template locals
  site_title
  site_code
  site_url
  [and all the settings variables]
  
  
front end tools

  darkwave.api_request({
    url: '/', // required
    data: {},
    callback: function(result){
      alert(result);
    },
    debug: true // optional
  });



auth emails (welcome, pw reset) are sent with notifications@yourdomain.com. if you want to change this, do it yourself...you don't need to have a valid mailbox there, but set one up if you want to catch any replies from people.


how to use/extend .validate (checking for uniqueness with email addresses or whatever else you want)

how to check for required form fields

here's what comes with auth:

/login
/register
  & activation process
/forgot
  & pw reset process
/account/settings


here's the default behavior and here's how you can customize it

<br /><br />

<h2>more power?</h2>

need more power? maybe you should build an <a href="/obelisk">obelisk</a>
- if you have more than one darkwave app running on a server and/or you want fast/concurrent processing w/ node.js (do the fast and heavy lifting that php isn't particularly well-suited for doing)
- generic dw-compatible microservices that can be utilized by multiple apps
- http interface (you call it from the dw controllers, send it data/instructions via http api)

<br /><br />





















<Br /><br />



- [ ]  ?? dw docs api_request
if you give "url" param a full url, it will use that. otherwise it will treat your input as an api endpoint (if there's an api_root set, it will use that, otherwise it defaults to using the current server as a root (it's blank))
ex: { url: '/login' } would load [http://publicworks.static.city/login](http://publicworks.static.city/login) if darkwave.api_root were set


<br /><br />


















- [ ]  dw - what version of dropzone are we using??? - want to document the 'current' versions of each supporting lib in each release


<br /><br />

- [ ]  dw docs - components get their own section? (like obelisk)
    - components/patterns intro

        less of a feature and more of an ethos -- would love to have default profiles/configs for a11y & i18n
        but not have to think about it on every project

        - pick a pattern (messaging, forums, etc) and implement it, knowing that everything's generally covered (and note/warnings about what isn't)

        pre-built accessible web components
        taking the guess work out of best practices
        basic blocks, nothing too technical or over-engineered
        make it easy to do the right thing (without having to do a lot of work every time and worry that you're getting it wrong)

    darkwave patterns - like slices, a little bit of everything you need at each layer to accomplish a certain piece of functionality (front end, back end, database, url routing, etc)
    - building w/ pods (like ember) - your app is split into slices

- [ ]  docs components/patterns org (kitchen sink)
update new modules - blog from oip
starter kit w/ everything (text entry, textarea, quill, checkboxes, photo gallery, single photo upload, file uplad, etc) -- take away everything you don't need 
— from oip - blog/editor changes (admin.js [photo upload, save], quill dw css, admin css)
list headers colors
    - components for generic 'kitchen sink' form, you can find everything in one place and copy what you need ... currently 'blog/articles' module ... call it 'profiles' or something ... put it all in one repo
    -- Dw kitchen sink - every type of ui element (form element) and how to store/retrieve it
    Select, boolrnans, checkbox, photos, files, passwords, dates, required, tool tips, etc, etc
    -- kinda like this but w/ active admin form elements (and their back-end counterparts [http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/kitchen_sink.html](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/kitchen_sink.html)

    -- -- dw kitchen sink - searchable page that has everything, implemented example & tabbed code samples for copy/paste

    -- -- would also like to do it for each part of each component/module too (blog, profiles, etc)

    dw modules - consistent nomenclature (galleries, blogs/articles, files, etc) - db collections are consistently plural tho

    dw new components from ocean investor portal

    - gallery
    - ?? files?
    - "custom" boilerplate (used for projects...based on "profile" component)

    dw components - user profiles and directory
    -nrha pros
    -carlton landing builders guild
    -ocean mgmt tenants

<br /><br /><br /><br />

- docs db setup (best practices) - default table type - innodb + utf8/utf8_general

<br /><br /><br /><br />


- [ ]  BLOG COMPONENT - admin fix - blog component - "all users" -- > "all articles"
- [ ]  blog component - sql query add ENGINE (innodb) from user creation query (on install)
- [ ]  (from OIP) — blog component updates
    - blog save large image
        - new db column
        - new controllers (save/delete blog admin)
        - new templates (blog list/detail, responsive images)
    - dw blog add subtitle
    - and the text editor feels kinda janky!
    - text input styles - pa2 f5 (and not b/fw7)


<br /><br /><br /><br />

- [ ]  docs credits - dw.serielaize)( lifted from// https://vanillajstoolkit.com/helpers/serialize/
- [ ]  docs - "standards" dates stored as bigint, boolean is tinyint, all tables have a _id field and we write a special uniquid for each new record, dates stored as unix time, always use innodb/utf8
- [ ]  docs note - the password/hashing (auth tokens, is_admin, etc) functions use the site code. if you change it, it will "break" the credentials (cookies) for users who are logged in and they'll have to log in again
- dw features/docs - global loading state (& instructions on how to update (shout out to where we got it from, links to go make a new one))

- dw docs - after(/before?) install: perms on uploads folder need to be 0755 (default on my server...idk about yours)

- dw docs - on install check perms of upload folder - 0755


<br /><br /><br /><br />

it's not a framework, it's a lifestyle ... nothing really magic happening w/ the technology, just combining existing libs in a useful way. the important part is the workflow, organization, and coding conventions. ultimately we want to have a collection of copy paste code/components to make the process of building full-stack applications w/ these tools as fast and effortless as possible

<br /><br />

dw docs - reqs - some of the tools (alpine, i think?) only support evergreen browsers (ie, not ie11-) - maybe have some
polyfills for supporting older browsers?



<br /><br />

??upload docs
- sample code for working w/ uppy (like i'm doing for mgmt.ocean & jcdv)
- https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/
- also sample code for processing uploads w/ obelisk (using both uppy and dropzone as a front end, single vs multiple
- sample code for handling image galleries (copy/paste components w/ sort/edit functionality)
- the stuff i've done for (cb, oip, jcdv, mgmt.ocean, tenants, etc)

<br /><Br />








- default user groups
  - admin users (system managers, site admins...use all system/layout/dev/data tools in dw admin)
  - mgmt/content users (use data in admin app, content publishing, user mgmt, manage settings for...whatever...etc)
  - end-users - users of the site you build (people who use the "public" version, don't see or even know about the admin app) - web-site visitors, customers, etc
    - separateable depending on use case (buyers vs sellers, community members w/ roles, etc)

	dw docs

		integration recipes for adding new functionality [i really want to automate the installation of this from either the web admin or the cli]
			1. add the controllers
			2. link to the new files
			3. add the templates
			4. add any js/css/images
			5. add any db tables

		how does form validation work?
			which classes should you put where? and why? (validate, required, etc)

		building admin screens
			using the save/delete handlers (how they work, what they expect, etc)

		document how the login works (note that we have a field called "website" to fool bots)
		"zero to deployment" guide which talks about hosting, ideal enviornments, etc (for total noobs, not part of the fw, but good ideas to remember when setting up your site / solving this particular problem)

		uploads
			make sure your uploads folder is set to 755
			if it's not working, turn on debugging and check this shit out: https://www.startutorial.com/articles/view/move_uploaded_file-faq
